# Getting Started

After download/clone use npm install to install all dependencies

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the watch mode.

## My solution step

For the first - create react app and init node server, then:
- Work with server side:
    - init server
    - connect to mongoDB
    - describe GET, POST, PUT and DELETE request
    - use multer to save images on server
    - use fs to delete images from server
- Work with client side:
    - realize routing
    - create some component
    - use axios to manage request to server
    - use pagination to realize pagination
    - implement some bootstrap and css for beautiful appearance
